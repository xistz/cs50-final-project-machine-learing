Final project for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

An Image Classifier web application

Web application built using Python Flask
Image Classifier built using PyTorch and a pretrained vgg19 model

Image Classifier was reused from Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

The frontend allows one picture to be uploaded at a time
The backend application requests the picture and passes the picture through the model
The backend application then returns the predicted flower name and a description of the flower
The frontend then displays the picture, the predicted name, and the description of the flower
